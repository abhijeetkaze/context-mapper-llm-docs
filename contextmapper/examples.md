# Examples

Please find the CML examples featured on this page in the following GitHub repository: <https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-examples>.

In the examples repository, you can find the domain model and strategic DDD description of the services and application landscape in Lakeside Mutual, a fictitious insurance company, and the CML version of a classical DDD sample (cargo routing and tracking).

The following graphical illustrations of our sample Context Maps are inspired by [Vernon](https://www.amazon.de/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577) and [Brandolini](https://www.infoq.com/articles/ddd-contextmapping).

## Architectural Refactoring (AR) Examples

The following folder contains a number of small CML snippets from the insurance example; they illustrate how you can apply refactorings to your models:
