# Generators Overview

The Context Mapper generators provide transformations to derive graphical Context Maps, [PlantUML diagrams](http://plantuml.com/), and
[Microservice Domain-Specific Langauge (MDSL)](https://microservice-api-patterns.github.io/MDSL-Specification/) (micro-)service contracts from your CML context map. We also provide a [generic, template-based generator](/docs/generic-freemarker-generator/)
based on Freemarker which allows to generate arbitrary textual files.

**Generators:**

* [Graphical context maps](#graphical-context-maps)
* [PlantUML diagrams](#plantuml-diagrams)
* [MDSL (micro-)service contracts](#mdsl-micro-service-contracts)
* [Generic, template-based textual generator (Freemarker Templating)](#generic-textual-generator-freemarker-templating)

## Using the Generators

### Visual Studio Code

The generators are implemented as commands in VS Code. You can find them in the context menu of the CML editor:

[![Generators Context Menu in VS Code](/img/generators-in-vscode-1.png)](/img/generators-in-vscode-1.png)

Alternatively you find them in the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P):

[![Generators in the VS Code Command Palette](/img/generators-in-vscode-2.png)](/img/generators-in-vscode-2.png)

### Eclipse

The generators can be accessed through the Context Menu in the project explorer (right-click to \*.cml file) or directly in the CML editor as the following screenshot shows:

[![Generators Context Menu in Eclipse](/img/generators-context-menu.png)](/img/generators-context-menu.png)

*Note*: In the CML editor, you can also access all generators with the keybinding **Shift+Alt+G** quickly.

## Graphical Context Maps

The Context Map generator allows you to transform the CML Context Map into graphical representation inspired by the illustrations of
[Vernon](https://www.amazon.de/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577) and
[Brandolini](https://www.infoq.com/articles/ddd-contextmapping/). You can find out how to generate them [here](/docs/context-map-generator/).

A sample Context Map produced with our generator is:

## PlantUML Diagrams

You can generate [plantUML](http://plantuml.com/) component diagrams out of CML context maps. Additionally, the transformation
generates UML class diagrams for all bounded contexts. If the implemented subdomains contain entities, the generator produces class diagrams for these subdomains as well. [This page](/docs/plant-uml/) describes how to generate them.

## MDSL (Micro-)Service Contracts

With our [MDSL](https://microservice-api-patterns.github.io/MDSL-Specification/) generator you can generate (micro-)service contracts from your Context Maps (or, more precisely, from upstream bounded contexts that expose at least one aggregate that contains at least one operation in a service or entity).
The resulting contracts illustrate how you can derive (micro-)services from strategic DDD context maps and provide
assistance regarding how to implement your system as a (micro-)service-oriented architecture.

This is an examplary [MDSL](https://microservice-api-patterns.github.io/MDSL-Specification/) service contract for our
[insurance example](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-examples/tree/master/src/main/cml/insurance-example):

  // This context represents a web application which allows the customer to login and change basic data records like the address.
  consumes CustomersAggregate

## Generic Textual Generator (Freemarker)

The generic, template-based generator allows you to generate arbitrary text files from CML Context Maps. It uses [Freemarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/) as its template engine and exposes the entire CML content as an object tree whose elements can be injected into the template.

Learn more about this generator [here](/docs/generic-freemarker-generator/).
