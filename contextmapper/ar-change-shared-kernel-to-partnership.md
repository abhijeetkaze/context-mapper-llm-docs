This simple relationship refactoring changes a Shared Kernel relationship on a Context Map to a Partnership relationship.

## Summary

Our relationship refactorings allow the user/modeller to change the type of a relationship on a Context Map easily without manual work.
The symmetric relationships according to our [semantic model](/docs/language-model/), Shared Kernel and Partnership, are interchangeable without impacts
to the structure of the decomposition. This refactoring changes a Shared Kernel relationship to a Partnership relationship.
